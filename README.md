      <h1>Welcome to Candy Crush!</h1>
      <p>In this game, your objective is to match candies of the same color in order to clear them from the board and earn points. The more candies you match at once, the more points you will earn.</p>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>To play, simply swipe candies in any direction to swap them with adjacent candies.</li>
         <li>Matching three candies of the same color will clear them from the board and earn you points.</li>
         <li>Matching four or more candies of the same color will create special candies that can clear entire rows or columns, or clear all candies of the same color.</li>
         <li>Each level has a different objective, which could be clearing a certain number of candies, reaching a certain score, or completing a specific task.</li>
         <li>You have a limited number of moves to complete each level, so use them wisely!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Power-Ups</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>The striped candy can clear an entire row or column of candies when matched with two candies of the same color.</li>
         <li>The wrapped candy can clear a 3x3 area of candies when matched with two candies of the same color.</li>
         <li>The color bomb can clear all candies of the same color when matched with any candy.</li>
         <li>To activate a power-up, simply match it with two candies of the same color.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Boosters</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Boosters are special items that can help you complete levels more easily.</li>
         <li>Boosters can be purchased using gold bars, which can be earned by completing levels or purchased with real money.</li>
         <li>Some examples of boosters are: the lollipop hammer, which can clear any one candy on the board; the jelly fish, which can clear jelly from the board; and the coconut wheel, which can clear a row or column of candies.</li>
